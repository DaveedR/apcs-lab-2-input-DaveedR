# apcsa-input
### For this lab, please use the Input.java file to create the following lines of input:

Enter an integer: 2
Enter an integer: 3

Enter a double: 4
Enter a double: 5

Enter a float: 6
Enter a float: 7

Enter a short: 8
Enter a short: 9

### Then, the program should create the following output:
integer one = 2
integer two = 3

double one = 4.0
double two = 5.0

float one = 6.0
float two = 7.0

short one = 8
short two = 9

### For a 10 point bonus...add this to your output

intOne + intTwo = 5
doubleOne + doubleTwo = 9.0

### For another 10 point bonus ... have your program input and output both byte and long variables
